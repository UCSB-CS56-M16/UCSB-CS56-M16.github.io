Part of this homework concerns the parser which was livecoded in class, which is available online here: [https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-M16/cs56-livecoded-parser](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-M16/cs56-livecoded-parser).

The rest concerns <span data-hfdp="3">HFDP Chapter 3</span> and
<span data-hfdp="10">HFDP Chapter 10</span>.  Please read those chapters, 
then answer these questions.

{% include hwk_li_name_10pts.html %}

<li>
(12 pts) The code in the box below does not use <tt>final</tt>.  Circle variable definitions which could be marked with <tt>final</tt>.  Each correctly identified variable is worth three points.

<div style="width: 20em; float:bottom; border: 1px solid black;" markdown="1">
```java
public class Foo {
  public boolean b;
  public Foo(boolean b) {
    this.b = b;
  }
  public static void bar(boolean b) {
    Foo f = new Foo(b);
    f.b = !b;
  }
}
```
</div>

</li>

<li>
Methods in the livecoded parser keep track of the current position in the input by passing around an <tt>int</tt> parameter.
That is, methods take an <tt>int</tt> position to start from and return an updated <tt>int</tt> position reflecting where to resume parsing the input from.

An alternative approach here is to have a single <tt>int</tt> instance variable which keeps track of the current position in the input.  As parsing proceeds, this variable can be updated to reflect position changes.

<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom:8em;">(5 pts) Name one advantage of the current approach, based on passing around the <tt>int</tt> parameter.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:8em;">(5 pts) Name one advantage of the alternative approach, based on mutating a single <tt>int</tt> instance variable.</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) A Java constructor, invoked with `new`, and a method of a Factory object (one created using the Factory design pattern) can both be used to create instances of new objects.   What is the situation in which a Factory object is preferred to just instantiating a class with `new`?   That is, what problem does the factory design pattern solve?

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Explain how the
Factory design pattern and the Abstract Factory design pattern are different.

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;">
In HFDP chapter 10, the running example with the gumball machine initially uses an <tt>int</tt> to keep track of what state the machine is in, as opposed to using the state pattern.

<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom:8em;">
(8 pts) Name two advantages of applying the state pattern to this example
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:8em;">
(5 pts) Name one <b>disadvantage</b> of applying the state pattern to this example
</li>
</ul>

</li>
