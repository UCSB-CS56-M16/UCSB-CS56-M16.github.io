{% include hwk_li_name_10pts.html %}


<li style="margin-bottom:3em;" markdown="1"> 
(10 pts) From <span data-hfj="11">Chapter 11</span>: Write the code that creates a new kind of exception called <code>BadSuitException</code>.  This exception might be thrown, for example, by a program that expects a character that is one of 'H','D','C','S' for Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs and Spades when it encounters an illegal value (one other than 'H', 'D','C' or 'S'.)   <code>BadSuitException</code> should be a subclass of <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.   Write ONLY the code that creates the new kind of exception. <b>HINT:</b> If you do this properly, it should be *very* short.  

</li>
