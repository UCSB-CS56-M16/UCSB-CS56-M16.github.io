*Reading Assignment:* 

* Read <span data-hfj="3"></span> (especially pages 59-62) and online reading notes.
* Read <span data-hfj="4"></span> and online reading notes.
    * If you don't have your book yet, buy it!  But in the meantime you can read this either at the UCSB library, or online.
    * Visit the course wiki at http://foo.cs.ucsb.edu/56wiki and you'll find the link to the online textbook.   
* As you read, also consult the online reading notes.   To find them, go to the online version of this homework, at {{ page.url }} and click the links.
* Then, do the problems below.

<li> Based on your reading in <span data-hfj="3" ></span>:

<ol>

<li style="margin-bottom: 5em;" markdown="1">
(5 pts) In Java, a variable can store a *primitive* or a *reference*.  Briefly: What's the difference?
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1">

(5 pts) If I write `3.4`, is that of type `double`, or `float`?

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1">

(5 pts) Declare `x` as a `double` and assign it the value 3.4 (as a `double`)

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 4em;" markdown="1">

(5 pts) Declare `y` as a `float` and assign it the value 3.4 (as a `float`)

</li>

</ol>

</li>


<li style="margin-bottom:3em;" markdown="1">

(5 pts) In C++, the name of a plain old array  of `Student` objects is not an object, but is rather a pointer to a `Student` (i.e. it is of type `Student *`.  What about in Java&mdash;is an array an object, yes or no?
<div class="pagebreak"></div>

</li>


<li markdown="1">
Variables that represent a primitive type (e.g. `boolean x;` or `int y;`) and  variables containing  object references (`String w;` or `Student z;`) have this in common&mdash;they are both composed of bits in memory.

But, as explained in <span data-hfj="3" ></span>, they differ in what the bits ''actually'' represent.   You won't get this one by just guessing&mdash;you really have to read the book.

<ol>

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1"> 
(5 pts) What do the bits that represent `int y;` represent?

Assume that `y` is assigned the value 13

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1">

(5 pts) What do the bits that represent `String w;` represent?

Assume that `w` is assigned the value `"foo"`.

</li>
</ol>

</li>


<li markdown="1"> Based on your reading in <span data-hfj="3" ></span>, p. 59-62
  and <span data-hfj="4" ></span> p. 84:

 <ol>
  <li style="margin-bottom:4em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) 
  Suppose I have a class called `Student`.   
  How do I declare and allocate space for a plain old Java array called `students` that can hold 5 references to Student objects?
  </li>

  <li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) 

 Java `for` loops look pretty much just like C++ `for` loops (see HFJ
 page 10 if you really need to check.)  Given that, assuming there is a
 default constructor `Student()` that you can call to create
 a new `Student` object, write a `for` loop that
 initializes all of the elements of the array `students`
 (from the previous problem) to be instances of the
 `Student`> class. 
  </li>

 </ol>
</li>


<li> Consider these questions about memory&mdash;answers are in <span data-hfj="3" ></span>

<ol>

<li style="margin-bottom:3em;" markdown="1"> 
(5 pts) Does the amount of memory taken up by 
an object reference differ for different kinds of objects (say `String` vs. `ArrayList<String>`?)
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:3em;"> (5 pts) Does the amount of memory
taken up by the object itself differ for different kinds of objects
(assuming the same JVM)? 
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:3em;" markdown="1"> (5 pts) Can the amount of memory
taking up for an object reference for a object particular type (say
`String`) differ from one JVM to another?
</li> 

</ol>

</li>

<li markdown="1"> <span data-hfj="4"></span> discusses the difference between the `==` operator and the `.equals` method.    

<ol>

<li style="margin-bottom:3em;" markdown="1">
(10 pts) Under what circumstances should you use the `==` operator to compare two variables? 
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:3em;" markdown="1">
(10 pts) Under what circumstances should you use the `.equals` method to compare two variables?
