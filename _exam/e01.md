# Midterm Exam

Link to actual exam: 

* [Actual Exam](cs56_m16_e01/){:data-ajax="false"}.
* [Handout](cs56_m16_e01/handout/){:data-ajax="false"}.
* [ArrayList handout](ArrayList/){:data-ajax="false"}.


[Typos and clarifications](typos){:data-ajax="false"}

Two practice exams are available.  Each comes with a handout. 

*    [A full 100 point practice exam, e01a](cs56_m16_e01_practice){:data-ajax="false"}, 
     and [handout](cs56_m16_e01_practice/handout){:data-ajax="false"}
*    [A partial practice exam, e01b](cs56_m16_e01_practice_b){:data-ajax="false"},
     and [handout](cs56_m16_e01_practice_b/handout){:data-ajax="false"}
*    WARNING: Just because a topic doesn't appear on either of these practice exams
     doesn't mean that it won't be covered on the midterm.
*    ADDITIONAL WARNING: The actual exam may or may not be more difficult/challenging than the practice
     exam given here.   Use this to practice, but if the practice exam seems "easy", don't 
     take that as a sign that you are "finished" studying.   I always try to come up with at least
     a few new "types of questions" for each exam.

## What is covered

* [H00](/hwk/h00){:data-ajax="false"} through [H06](/hwk/h06){:data-ajax="false"}
* Chapters 1 through 13 in HFJ.
* [lab00](/lab/lab00), [lab01](/lab/lab01), [lab02](/lab/lab02),  [lab03](/lab/lab03)
* Lecture notes from start of course up to the class before the exam.

## Links to past exams

Note that the exact coverage of each of these exams varies quite a bit, since the pace of topics, and placement of exams during the quarter can vary considerably.  You are encouraged to look at all of them as examples of the types of questions you might be asked, but
match them against the topics we have covered, vs. the ones we have not covered.

NOTE: NOT ALL PREVIOUS EXAMS ARE AVAILABLE.    The available ones are linked to below.
