Note: This is not a "complete" 100 point practice exam.  This is a place I'll put additional example problems as I encounter them
between now and the exam on Thursday.

(20 pts) For practice exam purposes: This exercise is a variation on the exercise on p. 266 in HFJ.  The answer to that one appears in the book, so I suggest you try that one first, then check your answer before attempting this problem.

On the [handout](handout) there is some code.    Your job: figure out after which line of main() each of the following objects is eligible for garbage collection. 

If an object is still not eligible for garbage collection when the last line of main is reached, write "never".    Your answer should be one of the line numbers that appears in comments in main (e.g. `/* 3 */` or `/* 7 */`) or the word "never".
