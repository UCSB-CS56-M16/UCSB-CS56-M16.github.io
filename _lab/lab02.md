In this lab, you'll be working in the pair partners that you chose during lecture on Tuesday June 28 in lecture via the [In-Class Assignment ic00](hwk/ic00).

Together with your pair partner, you will do the following steps:

1. Get an assignment of a one the repos from the list of [M16 lab02 available repos](lab02/repolist).  You can't just "choose" any one that you like; you need to be officially assigned one by a mentor, TA, or instructor.   They will record your choice on that page.
