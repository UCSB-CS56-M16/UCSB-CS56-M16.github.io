# Special Note for Solo and Trio Programmers

Note that although solo and trio situations are rare, they do sometimes happen.   Adjust the instructions using common sense.  For example:
* If you are solo programming, do what is needed for "pair partner 1", and disregard instructions for pair partner 2.
* If you are trio programming, read "partner" as "partners", "both&nbsp;partners" as "all&nbsp;three&nbsp;partners", and whatever is suggested for pair&nbsp;partner&nbsp;2, repeat the step for pair&nbsp;partner&nbsp;3.
