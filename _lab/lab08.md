This lab counts 300 points towards your lab grade.

# Issues for the next generation of CS56 students 

To complete this lab, and be DONE with the legacy code project, you need to do EACH of these things:

1.  Do some final edits in the README.md file of your legacy code
    project.  Put in a section called "{{site.qtr}} final remarks" and in
    it, write a short "note" to the next set of students that will work on
    this legacy code project.

    Tell them exactly what you think would be helpful for them to know
    as they start the project: what the code does, what features could
    be added, what bugs exist, what opportunities for refactoring you
    see.   Also add any advice you have on working with the code you have
    left them, for with legacy code in general.
    
2.  Add a new <tt>{{site.qtr}}_{{page.num}}.md</tt> file that contains
    links to 500
    points of issues for the next generation of CS56 students to work on.
    
    These may be issues that you came up with, or they may be issues
    left over from ones you mentor added, or a combination.   Regardless
    of how the issues got there, there should be at least 500 points
    worth of them.

    Note, however that for issues to count towards the 500 points,
    they must have a "M16 OK" comment from your mentor, another mentor,
    a TA or an instructor.  Leftover "W16 OK" comments do not count.
    And you MUST be in lab IN PERSON to get this "OK". (See below)

    
3.   Discuss the new issues FACE TO FACE with your mentor IN LAB.  You
     cannot rely on your pair partner to do this.  If only one pair partner
     shows up, on that THAT pair partner will get the credit for this
     lab.

     If you will not be in
     lab on that date, you need to arrange to do this with your mentor
     in advance, if they are kind enough to arrange to meet with you
     outside of class.
     That would also mean you have to be done with your legacy code
     project early.      And if your mentor is not available, you are
     out of luck&mdash;they have no obligation to accomodate your
     schedule.)

     Make sure that your mentor has signed off with an "M16 OK" comment
     on each issue that you are planning to count towards this 500.
     
4.   Do your FINAL pull request for your legacy code project, complying
     with all steps below, and checking in with your Mentor, *in person*,
     *face to face*.

Note: All of these steps are important.

The final pull request, and the discussing it face-to-face with your
mentor is part of ensuring that you get the points you are expecting
for your legacy code project grade.

The rest&mdash;the README.md with notes to the next set of students, and the issues in <tt>{{site.qtr}}_{{page.num}}.md</tt> , are part of your {{page.num}} grade.

= Grading =

* (50 pts): README.md note to next set of students.
* (200 pts): 500 points of issues remaining for the next generation of students on the main fork of your legacy code project.
    * Each issue must have an OK from a {{site.qtr}} mentor.
    * Any issue not ok'd by mentor by the due date/time of this lab DOES NOT COUNT.
* (50 pts): <tt>{{site.qtr}}_{{page.num}}.md</tt> file with the list of issues for the next CS56 class of students.


NOTE: May impose a 10% (30 point) penalty for failing to do the final pull request.
