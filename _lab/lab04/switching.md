If you are switching to a different legacy code project from the one that you worked on during the initial code review,
then you should first, for 250 points towards your project points, make a version of the {{site.qtr}\_lab02.md file 
for the new repo to which you are assigned.

This will involve forking the new repo you are assigned to, following the instructions from [lab02](/lab/lab02).

This will help you get oriented to the new repo that you are now working on.

You should also be sure that your mentor updates their records of which repo you are working on.

It is unlikely that you will be assigned to a different mentor, but if that does happen, due to changes in pair assignments, please make sure your mentor has this updated information.

*Note to mentors:* Please be sure to update whatever pages on the website, spreadsheets, etc. we may be using to track the assignments of students to pairs and legacy code projects, and double check as part of this lab, that all of those are up-to-date.  For example: [/lab/lab02/repo_list](/lab/lab02/repo_list).

Students: Please have your mentor add a special "issue" to the UCSB-CS56-Projects version of the new repo you are working on for 200 points for completing this new version of the {{site.qtr}\_lab02.md  file.

From that point, you should be able to follow the rest of the instructions just as if you had been working on this repo from the start.  Note that because of this extra orientation step, you'll be a little "behind" the pace you would have been on if you had continued with the same repo.  But we have made up for that by awarding 250 points for redoing the repo orientation step.  Because of earning 250 points for that, you are now only requiredto complete 250 points of coding issues for this round of work on the legacy code project instead of 500.   You will still have to complete at least 500 beyond that by the end of the course.
